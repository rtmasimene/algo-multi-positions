# algo-multi-positions
I developed this algorithm to automatically open multiple trade positions/orders on MetaTrader 5 based on input parameters. 

- **Problem statement**: Sometimes I want to place 10, 20, 30, 40+ orders at different price levels but it is too tedious and time-consuming to do so manually.
- **Solution**: Develop an algorithim that will automate this for me based on a set of paramaters.
- **Exampl**e: Open 15 buy/sell positions X pips apart from Y price level.
- **Result**: 15 buy/sell positions opened X pips apart from Y price level, done in milliseconds.
